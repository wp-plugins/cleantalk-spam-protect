== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work with spam comments? =

= How does the plugin stop spam? =
Plugin uses several simple tests to stop spammers.

1. JavaScript anti-spam test. 99% spam bots doesn't have all JavaScript functions support. So, the plugin has code which can run normal visitor and can't run the spam bot.
1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.
1. Comment submit time. Spam bots usually send post immediately after page load, because spam bots not really fill the web form, they are only send $_POST data to the blog. The normal visitor sends the data within several seconds or minutes.

= Will anti-spam protects my theme? =

= Can I use CleanTalk with Akismet? =

= Should I use another anti-spam tools (Captcha)? =
CleanTalk stops up to 100% of spam bots, so you can disable other anti-spam plugins (especially CAPTCHA like anti-spam plugins). In some cases several anti-spam plugins can conflict, so it will be better use just one plugin.  

= Is the plugin WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible? =
The plugin is WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible. Each blog in multisite environment has individual anti-spam options for spam bots protection.

= After installation I noticed in the statistics that the number of spam attacks had increased =
There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spam bots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

= Why my dummy "spam" comment passed to the WordPress? =
The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

The comments will be passed, becuase the plugin detect sender as a human. So, use special email *stop_email@example.com* to test anti-spam or wait a few days to see how the plugin works. 

= Is it free or paid? =
The plugin is free. But the plugin uses CleanTalk cloud service to filter spam bots. You have to register an account and you have two weeks free trial to test anti-spam for comments, registrations, bookings, contacts or orders. When the trial (on CleanTalk account) is finished, you can renew the subscription for 1 year or deactivate anti-spam plugin.

= Can I use CleanTalk with cache plugins? =
Anti-spam by CleanTalk doesn't use static HTML code into templates, so all anti-spam functions works correctly with any WordPress cache plugins.

= Does the plugin protects against spam bots at forms with third-party services? =
If your contact or subscribe form sends data to third-party servers (like mailchimp.com and etc.) the plugin will not protect your form against spam bots. Because the plugin protects only forms which are sends data directly to your WordPress website.

= What is "Connection test" message? =
After activation CleanTalk sends test message with email stop_email@example.com. This request required for test our plugin and in some cases it can give us information about problems in plugin, so you can contact our support in time.
