= How to protect sites from spam bots without CAPTCHA? =
The most popular method is CAPTCHA -- the annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are offered to the visitor to fill in. It is supposed that spam bots wonâ€™t discern these CAPTCHA, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if one wants to speak out, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. 
Sometimes CAPTCHA reminds doodle 2x year old child. For users with vision problems captcha is just an insurmountable obstacle. Users hate captcha. Captcha for users means "hate". Unreadable CAPTCHA stops about 80% of site visitors. After 2 failed attempts to bring it up to 95% reject further attempts. 
At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource both from bots and visitors. CAPTCHA is not a panacea from spam. Doubts Concerning the Need for CAPTCHA?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work with spam comments? =
Spam comments moves to SPAM folder or you can set option to silent ban spam comments.

= How does the plugin stop spam? =
Plugin uses several simple tests to stop spammers.

1. JavaScript anti spam test. 99% spam bots doesn't have all JavaScript functions support. So, the plugin has code which can run normal visitor and can't run the spam bot.
1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.
1. Comment submit time. Spam bots usually send post immediately after page load, because spam bots not really fill the web form, they are only send $_POST data to the blog. The normal visitor send the data within several seconds or minutes.
1. Relevance test for the comments. Spam bots posts send to the blog comments which are not matched with article by relevance, so the plugin can filter spam bots with offtop filter.

= Will anti spam protects my theme? =
Yes, it will. The plugin compatible with any WordPress themes.

= How can I test anti spam protection? =
Please use email **stop_email@example.com** for comments, contacts or signups. Also you can see comments processed by plugin for last 7 days at <a href="http://cleantalk.org/my/show_requests">Control panel</a> or look at folder "Spam" for banned comments.

= Can I use CleanTalk with Akismet? =
Sure, you can use CleanTalk with Akismet. In this case probably you will have bigger false/positive rate (when legitimate comments/signups denies), but you will have stronger antispam protection at website.

= Should I use another anti spam plugins? =
CleanTalk stops up to 100% of spam bots, so you can disable other anti spam plugins (especially CAPTCHA like anti spam plugins). In some cases several anti-spam plugins can conflict, so it will be better use just one plugin.  

= The plugin WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible? =
The plugin is WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible. Each blog in multisite environment has individual anit spam options for spam bots protection.

= After the installation I noticed in the statistics that the number of spam attacks had increased =
There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spam bots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

= Why my dummy "spam" comment passed to the WordPress? =
The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

The comments will be passed, becuase the plugin detect sender as a human. So, use special email *stop_email@example.com* to test anti-spam or wait a few days to see how the plugin works. 

= Can I use CleanTalk with cache plugins? =
CleanTalk doesn't use static HTML code into templates, so all anit spam functions will works correctly with any WordPress cache plugins.
