== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the plugin work with spam comments? =
Spam comments moves to SPAM folder. First comment from a new author plugin compares with post and previous comments. If the relevance of the comment is good enough it gets approval at the blog without manual approval.

= How does the plugin stop spam? =
Plugin uses several simple tests to stop spammers.

1. JavaScript anti spam test. 99% spam bots doesn't have all JavaScript functions support. So, the plugin has code which can run normal visitor and can't run the spam bot.
1. Checks by Email, IP, domains at spam activities list. The plugin online use spam activity database at cleantalk.org, which are consist more then 1 billion records about spam activity IPs, Email, Domains and ASN. If the senders IP or Email matches with database, the sender gets some spam scores. To reduce false/positive rate the plugin doesn't use only blacklist test to ban spammers. The sender will be banned only if multiple spam test failed.
1. Comment submit time. Spam bots usually send post immediately after page load, because spam bots not really fill the web form, they are only send $_POST data to the blog. The normal visitor send the data within several seconds or minutes.
1. Relevance test for the comments. Spam bots posts send to the blog comments which are not matched with article by relevance, so the plugin can filter spam bots with offtop filter.

= Will anti spam protects my theme? =
Yes, it will. The plugin compatible with any WordPress themes.

= How can I test anti-spam protection? =
Please use email **stop_email@example.com** for comments, contacts or signups. Also you can see comments processed by plugin for last 7 days at <a href="http://cleantalk.org/my/show_requests">Control panel</a> or look at folder "Spam" for banned comments.

= Is the plugin effective against spam bots? =
Plugin Anti-spam by CleanTalk stops up to 100% of spam comments, spam signups (registrations) and spam contact emails. More over, by determining the relevance of the comment text, the plugin stops about 96% spam comments submitted manually via browser. 

= What about pingback, trackback spam? = 
Plugin by default pass pingbacks without any checks. All trackbacks will be blocked if the sender have spam activity.

= Should I use another anti spam plugins? =
CleanTalk stops up to 100% of spam bots, so you can disable other anti spam plugins (especially CAPTCHA like anti spam plugins). In some cases several anti-spam plugins can conflict, so it will be better use just one plugin.  

= The plugin WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible? =
The plugin is WordPress MultiUser (WPMU or WordPress network) compatible. Each blog in multisite environment has individual anit spam options for spam bots protection.

= After the installation I noticed in the statistics that the number of spam attacks had increased =
There are a few reasons for this:

* With the indexing of your web-site by the search systems, appearance of external links and better search results position, your web-site attracts more and more spambots.
* Non-transparent protection systems like CAPTCHA or question/answer, that don't have spam attacks statistics, don't let you see the whole picture, or the picture is incomplete.
* Counting methods for spam attacks and spambots are different for different systems, which explains the diversity. We seek to provide detailed statistics.

= Why my dummy "spam" comment passed to the WordPress? =
The plugin has several options to detect spam bots and humans. If you just post spammy text like this,

    "I want to sell something", "Buy something here.." and etc

The comments will be passed, becuase the plugin detect sender as a human. So, use special email *stop_email@example.com* to test anti-spam or wait a few days to see how the plugin works. 

= Can I use CleanTalk with cache plugins? =
CleanTalk doesn't use static HTML code into templates, so all anit spam functions will works correctly with any WordPress cache plugins.

= Troubleshooting Guide =
<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cleantalk-spam-protect">Anti-spam by CleanTalk support forum</a> | <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/faq/">Plugin FAQ</a>

If you're having trouble getting things to work after installing the plugin, here are a few things to check:

1. If you haven't yet, please upgrade plugin to the latest version.
1. If you have error '*** Forbidden. Enable JavaScript. Anti-spam service cleantalk.org. ***' please check JavaScript support in your browser and do JavaScript test at this page <a href="http://cleantalk.org/checkout-javascript-support">Check out JavaScript support</a>.
1. If you have spam comments, signups or contacts please check the Access key at plugin settings. The key should be same as you can find in service <a href="https://cleantalk.org/my/">Control panel</a>.
1. If you have spam contact emails after plugin installation, please check your plugin with list of supported contact forms (see section **Anti-spam protection**). 

= CAPTCHA = 
The annoying picture with curved and sloping symbols, which are offered to the visitor to fill in. It is supposed that spam bots won’t discern these symbols, but a visitor will. CAPTCHA provokes great irritation, but if one wants to speak out, he has to fill in these symbols time after time, making mistakes and starting once again. At the sight of CAPTCHA and after input errors, many visitors leave the resource. Thus, CAPTCHA helps to protect the resource from visitors. Spam bots can automatically recognize Captcha. 
Spam bots can not pass through the anti spam CleanTalk, complex invisible checks can immediately detect spam bots.

= Requirements =
WordPress 3.0 at least. PHP 4, 5 with CURL or file_get_contents() function and enabled 'allow_url_fopen' setting. <a href="http://cleantalk.org/register?platform=wordpress">Sign up</a> to get an Access key.
